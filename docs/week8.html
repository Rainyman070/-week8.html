  <p class="first">Of all the weapons in the vast soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947.</p>
  <p class="first">More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. </p>
  <p class="first"> A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood.</p>
  <p class="first">It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. </p>
  <p class="second"> The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. </p>
  <p class="second">Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export.</p>
  <p class="second">After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.</p>
